# Feature flags in dart sample

A companion repo for **How to use feature flags in Dart**.

## About

This is a fictional thumbnail image converter app. It is used to demonstrate how to use feature flags in Dart.

Here is a screenshot:

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot here -->

## How it works

Think of the thumbnail converter component as the new feature to be rolled out. With the help of a cloud-hosted feature flag service like [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com/) We created a feature flag for this component. This enabled us to enable or disable the component remotely by toggling its flag on or off respectively.

## Build and Run

### Pre-requisites

- Dart SDK version: 2.17.6 - Install instructions for your specific operating system can be found [here](https://dart.dev/tutorials/web/get-started#2-install-dart).

- A Dart compatible IDE/Editor - eg. Visual Studio Code. A list of supported IDEs can be found [here](https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors) 

### Running the app

- Run the following command to build and serve the app:

```bash
webdev serve
```
